# 📌 Snippets.dev

**Snippets.dev** is an open-source SaaS platform that helps developers **save, organize, and share code snippets** across any programming language.

💡 Think of it as your **personal developer vault** — a central place where you store reusable code pieces so you never have to write the same logic twice.

---

## 🚀 Why Snippets.dev?

As developers, we often find ourselves **copying and pasting the same code**, over and over — a database query, a validation function, an environment config…

> ✨ Snippets.dev gives you a clean, searchable space to organize all your favorite bits of code and reuse them whenever you need.
